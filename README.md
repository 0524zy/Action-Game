# Action-Game
(b)
* Name: Yang Zhang
* Project Name: Develop an action game
* Project Description: Develop an action game with excellent and high AI enemies, whichi will be something like "Ninja Gaiden" 
  series on Xbox 360.
* Project Goals: To make a better action game than "Ninja Gaiden". After all, "Ninja Gaiden Black" and "Ninja Gaiden 2" are not 
  perfect enough. I would like players to meet more difficult challenges while playing the game, so that they will develop better
  skills and feel proud of themselves.
